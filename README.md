# Exploring_3D_Pathfinding_In_Unity
 A* algorithm in Unity, over 3D space.
 
 
 This is more or less copy-pasted from Sebastian Lague's pathfinding system, but written to accomodate 3 dimensions instead of only 2. I'm hoping to also convert the multithreading bits to be multithreaded through the jobs system.

|To Do|
|-----|
| ☑️ 3D Grid| 
| ☑️ 3D Pathfinding  |
| ☑️ Heap Optimization|
| ☐ Smooth weighting over 3d grid|
| ☐ path smoothing in 3d grid|
| ☐ optimizing the heap optimization|
| ☐ multithreading through jobs|
