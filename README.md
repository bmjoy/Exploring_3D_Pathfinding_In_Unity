# Exploring_3D_Pathfinding_In_Unity
 A* algorithm in Unity, over 3D space.
 
 
 This is more or less copy-pasted from Sebastian Lague's pathfinding system, but written to accomodate 3 dimensions instead of only 2. I'm hoping to also convert the multithreading bits to be multithreaded through the jobs system, though it doesn't seem very likely.
